# aggregations/functional-form delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Positional parameters fold onto declared parameter order
An aggregation call MAY pass declared parameters positionally after its source
(or, for a re-aggregation, after its operand): positional values SHALL bind to
the aggregation's declared parameter order — the built-in registry
(`percentile` → `p`; `weighted_avg` → `weight`; `corr`/`covar_samp`/`covar_pop`
→ `other`) or a custom aggregation's `params` declaration order — yielding the
identical aggregation identity, SQL, results, and result keys as the named
spelling. Passing a parameter both positionally and by name, or more positional
values than declared parameters, SHALL fail with a clear error naming the rule.
Ranked `first`/`last` declare no parameters — their positional ranking column
is untouched.

#### Scenario: Positional percentile equals named
- **WHEN** a measure is written `percentile(price, 0.9)` or `price:percentile(0.9)`
- **THEN** SQL, results, and result keys are identical to the `p=0.9` spellings

#### Scenario: Positional parameter on a re-aggregation outer
- **WHEN** a measure is written
  `percentile(sum(amount, partition_by=[city, region]), 0.9)`
- **THEN** it equals the `p=0.9` spelling by executed values

#### Scenario: Custom aggregation binds positionals by declared order
- **WHEN** a model declares `wavg(weight)` and a measure is written `wavg(amount, id)`
- **THEN** it equals `wavg(amount, weight=id)` by executed values

#### Scenario: Duplicate and excess positional parameters error
- **WHEN** `percentile(price, 0.9, p=0.5)` or `percentile(price, 0.9, 0.5)` is submitted
- **THEN** each fails with a clear error naming the duplicated parameter or the
  declared-parameter count

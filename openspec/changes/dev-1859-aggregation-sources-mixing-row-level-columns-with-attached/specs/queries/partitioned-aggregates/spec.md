## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Mixed sources carry the full expression-source surface
An aggregation source mixing row-level references with attached values SHALL
behave as a row-level expression source: everything legal for a plain
expression source is legal for it, and nothing more. The outer aggregation
SHALL support the plain scalar family, `count` (base rows with a non-null
operand value) and `count_distinct`, parametric and model-defined custom
aggregations — including multi-input built-ins and column-reference parameters
resolvable at row scope — and its own `partition_by=` and `window=`, each
resolved by the same rules as over a plain expression source. `first`/`last`
over the mixed expression SHALL keep the existing not-supported-over-an-
expression error. The shape SHALL be legal in measure, filter (typing as a
measure: pruning result rows without altering surviving values), and ORDER BY
positions, and as a computed dimension when grain-self-contained (the outer and
every inner aggregate explicitly grained). No producer or grouping step may
group by the row leaf or the attached value themselves — they feed the outer
aggregation only — and the mixed shape SHALL never be compiled through the
fully-attached carrier (whose cell-over-cell value differs). Row leaves keep
every existing expression-source restriction; attached constituents may be
cross-model, windowed, or themselves attached-input aggregations. A source
nesting a transform stays rejected. Discovery SHALL treat an aggregation that
owns attached inputs as opaque below its inputs (source and parameters): those
inputs belong to it — row-attached when it evaluates inline, owned by its own
producer when it is itself a producer answer — and are never discovered as
consumers of the enclosing level; its partition keys are not inputs and stay
visible to the enclosing level, so an attach-carrying computed dimension in
its `partition_by=` still gets the outer attach the grain join needs.

#### Scenario: Outer partition_by over a mixed source
- **WHEN** a query over `[region, product]` selects
  `sum(quantity * avg(unit_price, partition_by=product), partition_by=region)`
- **THEN** every row of a region carries that region's row-weighted total,
  broadcast exactly as any explicit-grain partitioned measure, by executed
  values

#### Scenario: Outer window over a mixed source
- **WHEN** a query with a month time dimension selects
  `sum(quantity * avg(unit_price, partition_by=product), window='90d')`
- **THEN** each bucket carries the trailing-90-day row-weighted total as of that
  bucket, by executed values

#### Scenario: Windowed constituent inside a mixed source
- **WHEN** a query with a month time dimension selects
  `sum(qty * sum(revenue, window='90d'))`
- **THEN** the windowed inner is exactly one nested producer at the bucket
  grain, row-attached into the outer aggregation's input relation — never an
  attach of the enclosing level — and each bucket carries the hand-computed
  row-weighted value, by executed values

#### Scenario: Parametric outer with a row-valued parameter
- **WHEN** a query selects
  `wavg(quantity * avg(unit_price, partition_by=product), weight=qty)` (a
  weighted average whose weight is a row column)
- **THEN** it executes with the hand-computed row-weighted average, never a
  column-parameter rejection

#### Scenario: Custom and multi-input aggregations over a mixed source
- **WHEN** a model-defined custom aggregation or a two-input built-in (e.g.
  `corr(quantity * avg(unit_price, partition_by=product), qty)`) consumes a
  mixed source
- **THEN** each executes with correct values through its own rendering path

#### Scenario: Count semantics over a mixed source
- **WHEN** a query selects `count(quantity * avg(unit_price, partition_by=product))`
- **THEN** each cell counts its base rows whose operand value is non-null

#### Scenario: Ranked aggregation over a mixed source keeps the expression error
- **WHEN** a query selects `first(quantity * avg(unit_price, partition_by=product))`
- **THEN** it fails with the existing error that `first` is not supported over
  an expression — never a mixing error and never wrong values

#### Scenario: Filter and order positions
- **WHEN** the mixed measure appears only in a filter
  (`sum(quantity * avg(unit_price, partition_by=product)) > 100`) or only as an
  ORDER BY target
- **THEN** the filter types as a measure — pruning result rows with surviving
  values unchanged — and the order sorts by the same value the measure form
  returns

#### Scenario: Grain-self-contained dimension position
- **WHEN** a query groups by a computed dimension banding
  `sum(quantity * avg(unit_price, partition_by=product), partition_by=region)`
- **THEN** rows group by the band with correct executed values and unchanged
  cardinality, and the plan carries one attach for the banded aggregation with
  the inner `avg` nested inside its producer — no separate top-level attach for
  the inner

#### Scenario: Adding a mixed measure is cardinality-neutral
- **WHEN** any supported query runs with and without an additional mixed-source
  measure
- **THEN** both runs return the same rows and identical values in all shared
  columns, and the emitted SQL leaks no internal placeholder names

#### Scenario: Never the fully-attached carrier
- **WHEN** the emitted SQL for a mixed-source measure is inspected
- **THEN** no relation groups by the attached value or the row leaf; the outer
  aggregation consumes base rows with the attached value joined on the
  constituent's complete grain

#### Scenario: A producer-bound mixed aggregation owns its inners
- **WHEN** a mixed aggregation is itself a producer answer (it carries its own
  `partition_by=`, `window=`, or is cross-model) and the plan is inspected
- **THEN** its inner constituents appear only inside that producer's plan,
  never as attaches of the enclosing level

#### Scenario: Partition keys stay visible through an opaque root
- **WHEN** a mixed aggregation declares `partition_by=` on an attach-carrying
  computed dimension of the query
- **THEN** that dimension's own attach is still planned at the enclosing level
  and the aggregation's producer joins back on it, with executed values equal
  to the same query spelled with a plain dimension

#### Scenario: One producer per distinct attached input
- **WHEN** the same attached aggregate appears twice — as a source constituent
  and as a parameter of one aggregation, or as an input of two different
  row-attach aggregations
- **THEN** the plan carries exactly one producer and one attach for it, every
  occurrence substitutes to that attach, total routing holds after
  substitution, and the executed values are correct

### Requirement: Attached parameters on row-level sources
An aggregation over a row-level source whose parameter — keyword or
positional; a definition default is Mode-A text and cannot carry an attached
value — is an attached (aggregate-valued) value SHALL compile when the
aggregation's operating grain determines the parameter. An aggregate is
determined by a grain iff that grain determines each of its partition keys: a
grain member, a column reached from a grain member over provably to-one join
hops, or an aggregate-valued key whose own grain is so determined; an
expression-valued partition key is determined only as an exact grain member.
The parameter's producer is computed at its own declared grain and its value
attached into the aggregation's input relation — per entity row for an
associate-mode aggregation, per population row otherwise — null-safely on the
producer's complete grain. The source alone decides that the aggregation runs
over rows: a source with any row-level leaf, or with no attached constituent at
all (a literal), is row grain; a parameter never changes that, and an attached
parameter beside a mixed source is attached by the same mechanism as the
source's constituents. A cross-model attached parameter on a local root
attaches through a target-rooted producer like any cross-model attached
constituent, subject to the existing input-safety rules. A NULL grain-key value
forms its own cell and attaches null-safely, per the established null rules. A
parameter the operating grain does not determine SHALL keep its typed
rejection. Outer parameters on fully-attached (re-aggregation) sources keep
their existing rules. The shape SHALL be legal in measure, filter (typing as a
measure) and ORDER BY positions.

#### Scenario: Associate-mode attached parameter executes
- **WHEN** a query rooted at `orders` over `[status]` under
  `to_many_handling: "associate"` selects
  `customers.spend:weighted_avg(weight=sum(amount, partition_by=customers.regions.name))`
- **THEN** each status cell carries the average of its distinct associated
  customers' spend, weighted by each customer's region total, by hand-computed
  executed values on SQLite and DuckDB

#### Scenario: A NULL-region entity weights by the NULL cell
- **WHEN** an associated customer has no region
- **THEN** its weight is the NULL-region cell's total — the NULL key forms its
  own cell and attaches null-safely, so an order with no customer counts in
  that same cell — by executed values

#### Scenario: Ordinary-mode attached parameter executes
- **WHEN** a locally-rooted query selects
  `weighted_avg(amount, weight=sum(amount, partition_by=region))` with `region`
  determined per row
- **THEN** it executes with the row-attached per-region weight, by executed
  values

#### Scenario: Attached parameter beside a mixed source
- **WHEN** a query over `[region]` selects
  `weighted_avg(quantity * avg(unit_price, partition_by=product), weight=sum(amount, partition_by=region))`
- **THEN** both attached inputs are row-attached into the aggregation's input
  relation, the executed value equals the hand-computed row-weighted average,
  and the emitted SQL leaks no placeholder — never a render-time failure

#### Scenario: Literal source with an attached parameter is row grain
- **WHEN** a query over `[region]` selects the model-defined
  `wsum(1, weight=sum(amount, partition_by=region))`
- **THEN** it aggregates over the population rows with the region total
  attached per row — each region equals its row count times its total — by
  executed values, never a re-aggregation over an empty grain

#### Scenario: Default-mode twin of the associate shape
- **WHEN** the associate-mode query above runs under the default
  `to_many_handling`
- **THEN** it fails at plan time with a typed error naming the producer's root
  `customers`, the leaf `amount` the root cannot reach, and the `associate`
  remedy — the parameter's producer would have to be rooted at `orders` and
  attached into the `customers`-rooted producer; the same aggregation with
  `weight=sum(customers.spend, partition_by=customers.regions.name)` executes,
  broadcast to every `status` cell with the usual warning; under
  `to_many_handling: "error"` the query fails with the mode's refusal naming
  the dimension, never a parameter error

#### Scenario: Cross-model attached parameter on a local root
- **WHEN** a query rooted at `orders` selects
  `amount:weighted_avg(weight=sum(customers.spend, partition_by=customers.regions.name))`
- **THEN** the parameter attaches through its target-rooted producer per order
  row and the query executes with hand-computed values; a parameter whose
  path crosses a fanning or unproven hop fails with the existing typed
  input-safety error, never wrong values

#### Scenario: Attached parameter in filter and order positions
- **WHEN** the ordinary-mode measure or the mixed-plus-parameter measure above
  appears only in a filter, only as a raw ORDER BY formula, or is ordered by
  the name of its projected measure
- **THEN** the filter types as a measure — pruning result rows with surviving
  values unchanged — and each order form sorts by the same value the measure
  form returns

#### Scenario: Partition-key kinds of a parameter aggregate
- **WHEN** an associate-mode parameter aggregate is grained by an aggregate-valued
  key whose own grain the entity determines, or by an expression key that is not
  a grain member
- **THEN** the first executes with the parameter read once per entity and the
  second fails with the typed determination error naming the parameter

#### Scenario: Undetermined attached parameter stays rejected
- **WHEN** the aggregation's operating grain does not determine the attached
  parameter
- **THEN** the query fails with the typed determination error, never wrong
  values

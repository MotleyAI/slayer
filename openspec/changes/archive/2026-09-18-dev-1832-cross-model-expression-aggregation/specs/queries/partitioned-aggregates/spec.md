## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Partitioned aggregates nested inside transforms
A transform SHALL accept a partitioned aggregate as its input when used as a measure — rank-family transforms and temporal transforms (`time_shift`, `change`, `change_pct`, `lag`, `lead`, `cumsum`, `consecutive_periods`) alike. The transform evaluates at its operand grain — the attached aggregate's `partition_by=`, else the query grain (Axiom 11.1) — and the measure consumer broadcasts the result onto the query grain (Axiom 11.4); it MUST never fail with an internal error.

#### Scenario: Running total of partition-grain values
- WHEN a query selects dimensions `[region, city, month(ordered_at)]` and the measure `cumsum(revenue:sum(partition_by=[region, ordered_at]))`
- THEN each row's value is the cumulative sum across months, within the row's non-time dimensions, of the attached region-month totals, verified by executed values

#### Scenario: Ranking result rows by an attached total
- WHEN a query selects the measure `rank(revenue:sum(partition_by=region))`
- THEN result rows are ranked by their attached region total at the query grain

#### Scenario: Change over a partitioned aggregate executes
- WHEN a query selects `change(amount:sum(partition_by=region))` or `change_pct(amount:sum(partition_by=region))` over a month time dimension
- THEN the query executes with the hand-computed bucket-over-previous-bucket difference (or ratio) of the attached value, instead of failing with an internal rendering error

### Requirement: Re-aggregation consumes attached operands as datasets
A partitioned aggregate, an explicitly grained transform, or a composite of them
SHALL be a legal aggregation source: the outer aggregation consumes the operand
dataset's cells per `queries/semantics` › Second-order aggregation over attached
values. A transform is a constituent like a partitioned aggregate, typed at the union of
its inner aggregates' effective grains — each inner's explicit `partition_by=`, else
the query grain (its dimensions and time buckets), a windowed inner contributing the
query's active time bucket (per `queries/computed-dimensions` › Transforms inside
dimension expressions) — and evaluated at that grain; a time-ordered transform
constituent whose grain does not contain its time axis SHALL fail with the same
time-axis error a dimension-position transform raises, the axis being named in
`partition_by=` exactly as in dimension position (a top-level measure transform is
unchanged and keeps evaluating at the query grain over the attached value); an
axis-collapsing transform constituent (`first`, `last`) is typed at that union minus
its time axis, realised as its axis-preserving evaluation followed by an exact
per-partition pick, so the axis resolves per `to_many_handling` like any dimension
the operand grain lacks; a transform with no explicitly grained inner aggregate types
at the query grain and follows the degenerate rule. The outer
aggregation SHALL support the plain scalar aggregation family —
`sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, `count`, `count_distinct`, `median`,
parametric aggregations, and model-defined custom aggregations; `count` counts
the operand's cells with a non-null value and `count_distinct` its distinct
values. The outer aggregation MAY declare its own `partition_by=`, resolved by
the same attributability and mode rules as its default (query-grain) form, and
its value behaves as a normal attached value in every consumer context —
measure, arithmetic or transform input, ORDER BY target, filter-only reference,
and computed dimension (with an explicit outer grain, per the dimension
grain-self-containment rule). `first`/`last` over an aggregated first argument
keep their transform dispatch. The outer aggregation's parameters — explicit,
positional, or defaulted by the aggregation definition — follow
`queries/semantics` › Aggregation parameters are typed by the home dataset's
grain against the operand dataset's grain: an aggregate grained within the
operand grain, or a column that grain determines, is picked once per cell and
read by the outer aggregation, and its partition keys are exempt from the
combined-consumer partition-key rule exactly as the source's constituents are;
a population-row column against a coarser cell grain, a definition default
naming such a column, or an aggregate grained outside the operand grain is a
typed error naming the parameter and the remedy. The outer aggregation SHALL
reject, with typed errors naming the combination and the remedy: `window=` or
ranked (`first`/`last`) aggregation over an attached operand, and a
measure-local `filter=` on the outer aggregation.

#### Scenario: Count and parametric outer aggregations
- **WHEN** a query over `[region]` selects
  `count(sum(amount, partition_by=[city, region]))` and
  `percentile(sum(amount, partition_by=[city, region]), p=0.9)`
- **THEN** each region row carries the number of its city cells with a non-null
  total and the 0.9-percentile of those totals, by executed values

#### Scenario: Grained transform constituent executes through the carrier
- **WHEN** a query over a month time dimension selects
  `sum(cumsum(amount:sum(partition_by=[region, ordered_at])) - 1)`
- **THEN** it executes with the hand-computed sum over regions of running totals
  minus one per cell on SQLite and DuckDB, the plan carries exactly one producer for
  the transform at its `(region, month)` grain inside the carrier, the emitted
  statement has one flat `WITH`, scopes are closed, and no placeholder leaks

#### Scenario: Every transform family executes as a constituent
- **WHEN** a query over a month time dimension selects, over
  `amount:sum(partition_by=[region, ordered_at])`, a `change`, a `lag`, a
  `consecutive_periods` and a `first`/`last` constituent under `sum`
- **THEN** each executes with hand-computed values on SQLite and DuckDB: the
  shift family through its self-join series, `lag` and `consecutive_periods` per
  cell, and `first`/`last` at the collapsed `(region)` grain

#### Scenario: Windowed inner under a transform constituent fails closed
- **WHEN** a query over a month time dimension selects
  `sum(rank(amount:sum(window='90d', partition_by=region)))`
- **THEN** it fails with the windowed time-dimension resolution error — never a
  misgrained or duplicated result — the shape being deferred to a follow-up issue

#### Scenario: Transform constituent without its time axis fails cleanly
- **WHEN** a query over a month time dimension selects
  `sum(cumsum(amount:sum(partition_by=region)))`
- **THEN** it fails with the time-axis error directing the author to include the time
  key in `partition_by=`, the same error the dimension-position form raises, and
  never returns duplicated or misgrained rows

#### Scenario: Time transform without a time dimension fails as a constituent
- **WHEN** a query with no `time_dimensions` selects
  `sum(cumsum(amount:sum(partition_by=[region, ordered_at])))`
- **THEN** it fails with the same unambiguous-time-dimension error a top-level
  `cumsum` raises

#### Scenario: Operand-grain parameter executes
- **WHEN** a query over `[region]` selects
  `weighted_avg(sum(amount, partition_by=[city, region]), weight=count(id, partition_by=[city, region]))`,
  and separately the custom `wavg(sum(amount, partition_by=[city, region]), weight=count(id, partition_by=[city, region]))`
  with the weight passed positionally
- **THEN** each region row carries the row-count-weighted average of its city totals,
  by hand-computed executed values on SQLite and DuckDB, the keyword and positional
  spellings identical, and the emitted SQL carries the parameter as a column of the
  operand carrier — one producer relation for the operand, no duplicate

#### Scenario: Parameter partition keys need not be query dimensions
- **WHEN** the outer aggregation's parameter is an aggregate grained at the operand grain
  and that grain's keys are not query dimensions
- **THEN** the query plans and executes without the combined-consumer partition-key
  error, exactly as the source's constituents are exempt

#### Scenario: Transform over a re-aggregated value
- **WHEN** a query selects `rank(avg(sum(amount, partition_by=[city, region])))`
- **THEN** result rows are ranked at the query grain by the attached
  re-aggregated value, and no other column's values change

#### Scenario: Explicit outer grain broadcasts per the combined rules
- **WHEN** a query over `[region, product]` selects
  `avg(sum(amount, partition_by=[city, region]), partition_by=region)`
- **THEN** the per-region average broadcasts across `product` exactly as any
  explicit-grain partitioned measure does, with no implicit-broadcast warning

#### Scenario: Filter on the re-aggregated value prunes only
- **WHEN** a query filters on `avg(sum(amount, partition_by=[city, region])) > 100`
- **THEN** only qualifying result rows remain and every surviving value equals
  the unfiltered query's value for that row

#### Scenario: Row-phase filters reach the inner producer
- **WHEN** the query carries a row-level filter conjunct
- **THEN** it restricts the inner producer's population per the established
  producer filter routing, and the re-aggregated value reflects it

#### Scenario: Row filters bound the operand dataset's cells
- **WHEN** a row filter removes every operand row of a union-grain cell and the
  operand is consumed through a NULL-restoring composite (e.g. `coalesce(…, 0)`)
- **THEN** the operand dataset excludes that cell — the composite cannot
  fabricate it — by executed values

#### Scenario: Column-reference outer parameter fails closed
- **WHEN** the outer aggregation carries a parameter the operand grain does not
  determine — explicit (`wavg(sum(amount, partition_by=[city, region]), weight=id)`)
  or defaulted by its aggregation definition to such a column
- **THEN** it fails at plan time with a typed error naming the parameter, the grain,
  and the remedy — never invalid SQL, a render-time failure, or a silently wrong value

#### Scenario: Outer window and outer filter fail closed
- **WHEN** a query selects `sum(sum(amount, partition_by=[city, region]), window='90d')`
  or gives the outer aggregation a measure-local `filter=`
- **THEN** each fails with a typed error naming the unsupported combination and
  the remedy — never a silently wrong value

#### Scenario: First and last keep transform dispatch
- **WHEN** a query selects `last(sum(amount, partition_by=[city, region]))`
- **THEN** it is the `last` transform over the aggregated series, unchanged

### Requirement: Mixed sources carry the full expression-source surface
An aggregation source mixing row-level references with attached values SHALL
behave as a row-level expression source: everything legal for a plain
expression source is legal for it, and nothing more. Row leaves MAY be host-model
or joined-model columns, homed per `queries/semantics` › Home dataset of a
row-level aggregation source; an explicitly grained transform is an attached
constituent exactly like a partitioned aggregate, except a collapsing (`first`/`last`)
constituent, which SHALL be rejected with a typed error when mixed with a row-level
reference (deferred to DEV-1928). The outer aggregation
SHALL support the plain scalar family, `count` (base rows with a non-null
operand value) and `count_distinct`, parametric and model-defined custom
aggregations — including multi-input built-ins and column-reference parameters
resolvable at row scope — and its own `partition_by=` and `window=`, each
resolved by the same rules as over a plain expression source. `first`/`last`
over the mixed expression SHALL keep the existing not-supported-over-an-
expression error. The shape SHALL be legal in measure, filter (typing as a
measure: pruning result rows without altering surviving values), and ORDER BY
positions, and as a computed dimension when grain-self-contained (the outer and
every inner aggregate explicitly grained). No producer or grouping step may
group by the row leaf or the attached value themselves — they feed the outer
aggregation only — and the mixed shape SHALL never be compiled through the
fully-attached carrier (whose cell-over-cell value differs). Row leaves keep
every existing expression-source restriction; attached constituents may be
cross-model, windowed, grained transforms, or themselves attached-input
aggregations. Discovery SHALL treat an aggregation that
owns attached inputs as opaque below its inputs (source and parameters): those
inputs belong to it — row-attached when it evaluates inline, owned by its own
producer when it is itself a producer answer — and are never discovered as
consumers of the enclosing level; its partition keys are not inputs and stay
visible to the enclosing level, so an attach-carrying computed dimension in
its `partition_by=` still gets the outer attach the grain join needs.

#### Scenario: Outer partition_by over a mixed source
- **WHEN** a query over `[region, product]` selects
  `sum(quantity * avg(unit_price, partition_by=product), partition_by=region)`
- **THEN** every row of a region carries that region's row-weighted total,
  broadcast exactly as any explicit-grain partitioned measure, by executed
  values

#### Scenario: Outer window over a mixed source
- **WHEN** a query with a month time dimension selects
  `sum(quantity * avg(unit_price, partition_by=product), window='90d')`
- **THEN** each bucket carries the trailing-90-day row-weighted total as of that
  bucket, by executed values

#### Scenario: Windowed constituent inside a mixed source
- **WHEN** a query with a month time dimension selects
  `sum(qty * sum(revenue, window='90d'))`
- **THEN** the windowed inner is exactly one nested producer at the bucket
  grain, row-attached into the outer aggregation's input relation — never an
  attach of the enclosing level — and each bucket carries the hand-computed
  row-weighted value, by executed values

#### Scenario: Transform constituent inside a mixed source
- **WHEN** a query over `[region]` selects
  `sum(quantity * rank(avg(unit_price, partition_by=product)))`
- **THEN** the transform is exactly one nested producer at its `(product)` grain,
  row-attached into the outer aggregation's input relation, and each region carries
  the hand-computed row-weighted value, by executed values — never the former
  nested-transform rejection

#### Scenario: Collapsing constituent mixed with a row leaf fails closed
- **WHEN** a query over a month time dimension selects
  `sum(amount * last(amount:sum(partition_by=[region, ordered_at])))`
- **THEN** it fails with a typed error naming the collapsing transform and the
  row-level column, never a broadcast or multiplied value

#### Scenario: Joined-model row leaf inside a mixed source
- **WHEN** a query rooted at `orders` over `[status]` selects
  `sum(customers.discount * avg(amount, partition_by=status))`
- **THEN** the source is homed at `orders`, the attached average is row-attached per
  order, and each status carries the hand-computed value, by executed values

#### Scenario: Parametric outer with a row-valued parameter
- **WHEN** a query selects
  `wavg(quantity * avg(unit_price, partition_by=product), weight=qty)` (a
  weighted average whose weight is a row column)
- **THEN** it executes with the hand-computed row-weighted average, never a
  column-parameter rejection

#### Scenario: Custom and multi-input aggregations over a mixed source
- **WHEN** a model-defined custom aggregation or a two-input built-in (e.g.
  `corr(quantity * avg(unit_price, partition_by=product), qty)`) consumes a
  mixed source
- **THEN** each executes with correct values through its own rendering path

#### Scenario: Count semantics over a mixed source
- **WHEN** a query selects `count(quantity * avg(unit_price, partition_by=product))`
- **THEN** each cell counts its base rows whose operand value is non-null

#### Scenario: Ranked aggregation over a mixed source keeps the expression error
- **WHEN** a query selects `first(quantity * avg(unit_price, partition_by=product))`
- **THEN** it fails with the existing error that `first` is not supported over
  an expression — never a mixing error and never wrong values

#### Scenario: Filter and order positions
- **WHEN** the mixed measure appears only in a filter
  (`sum(quantity * avg(unit_price, partition_by=product)) > 100`) or only as an
  ORDER BY target
- **THEN** the filter types as a measure — pruning result rows with surviving
  values unchanged — and the order sorts by the same value the measure form
  returns

#### Scenario: Grain-self-contained dimension position
- **WHEN** a query groups by a computed dimension banding
  `sum(quantity * avg(unit_price, partition_by=product), partition_by=region)`
- **THEN** rows group by the band with correct executed values and unchanged
  cardinality, and the plan carries one attach for the banded aggregation with
  the inner `avg` nested inside its producer — no separate top-level attach for
  the inner

#### Scenario: Adding a mixed measure is cardinality-neutral
- **WHEN** any supported query runs with and without an additional mixed-source
  measure
- **THEN** both runs return the same rows and identical values in all shared
  columns, and the emitted SQL leaks no internal placeholder names

#### Scenario: Never the fully-attached carrier
- **WHEN** the emitted SQL for a mixed-source measure is inspected
- **THEN** no relation groups by the attached value or the row leaf; the outer
  aggregation consumes base rows with the attached value joined on the
  constituent's complete grain

#### Scenario: A producer-bound mixed aggregation owns its inners
- **WHEN** a mixed aggregation is itself a producer answer (it carries its own
  `partition_by=`, `window=`, or is cross-model) and the plan is inspected
- **THEN** its inner constituents appear only inside that producer's plan,
  never as attaches of the enclosing level

#### Scenario: Partition keys stay visible through an opaque root
- **WHEN** a mixed aggregation declares `partition_by=` on an attach-carrying
  computed dimension of the query
- **THEN** that dimension's own attach is still planned at the enclosing level
  and the aggregation's producer joins back on it, with executed values equal
  to the same query spelled with a plain dimension

#### Scenario: One producer per distinct attached input
- **WHEN** the same attached aggregate appears twice — as a source constituent
  and as a parameter of one aggregation, or as an input of two different
  row-attach aggregations
- **THEN** the plan carries exactly one producer and one attach for it, every
  occurrence substitutes to that attach, total routing holds after
  substitution, and the executed values are correct
